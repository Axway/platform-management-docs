## Platform Management 10.1.0 - 25 March 2022

Platform Management 10.1.0 is a minor release which includes two new features and a fixed issue.

With this release, Insights (read only admin) and Collaborator role support has been removed. These deprecated roles were only available for organizations with Pro or Enterprise Application Development subscriptions. As those offerings reached [end-of-support on March 1, 2022](https://www.axway.com/en/appcelerator-end-of-life), all users with these deprecated roles assigned have been removed from their respective organizations. Events dated March 25, 2022 are noted in the *Activity* view for these removed users. These users can be re-added with Administrator or Developer role if needed.

## New features

* Added a Promoter Specialist service role available for subscribers of **Flow Manager**.
* Added a Subscription Admin team role available for subscribers of **Amplify API Management Platform** or **Amplify Hub**.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue where organization administrators were unable to delete a team without selecting a team to reassign its assets to.
