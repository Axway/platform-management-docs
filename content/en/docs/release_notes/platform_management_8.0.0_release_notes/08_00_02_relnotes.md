## Platform Management 8.0.2 - 4 August 2020

Platform Management 8.0.2 is a patch release, which includes two improvements and two bug fixes.

Please note that browser support for **Amplify Platform** has changed. Support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 has been deprecated and and will no longer function after September 30, 2020. Please visit [https://platform.axway.com/browser](https://platform.axway.com/browser) for the list of supported browsers and versions.

## Improvements

* For organizations subscribed to Application Integration, the Integration Builder link in the common header's services menu now provides links to available environments.
* Overview and app analytics chart/table views now link to open the corresponding query in the Custom Query view (requires Application Development Pro or Enterprise subscription or monthly Cloud Capacity subscription).

## Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where organizations with a large number of applications may experience intermittent browser instability or long load times when viewing their list of apps.
* Fixed an issue where attempting to navigate to a specific view when not signed in may experience a "page not found" error after signing in rather than being successfully redirected to the requested view.
