## Platform Management 13.0.0 - 14 Mar 2023

Platform Management 13.0.0 is a major release which includes one behavior change, one new feature, and one improvement.

With this release, Platform Management API endpoints related to use of **Mobile Backend Services** and **Amplify Runtime Services** previously marked as deprecated have be removed. All remaining **Amplify Runtime Services* environments have been decommissioned. Application types served by those environments will no longer be visible with the Platform.

## Behavior change

* Removed filtering by application type on the *Apps* view.

## New feature

* Added a *Marketplace Footer* view to capture settings for a customizable footer displayed on all **Marketplace** and related authentication views.

## Improvement

* The Help Menu and Nav Items captured previously on the *Marketplace Appearance* view have been relocated to a new *Marketplace Menus* view.
