### Change your password

1. Select the **Credentials** link.
2. Enter a new password in the **Change Password** field. The password should be at least eight characters (default requirements) or must adhere to the [password policy](/docs/management_guide/organizations/managing_organizations/#configure-password-settings) configured for your organization.

5. Click the **Save** button. The password change is saved and an Account Information Changed notification email is sent.

### Manage multi-factor authentication

Enable multi-factor authentication for increased security with authentication verification by an authenticator app, email, or SMS. Using MFA is optional, but **highly recommended.**

MFA definition (from Wikipedia)

_Multi-factor authentication (MFA; encompassing Two-factor authentication or 2FA, along with similar terms) is an  **electronic authentication method** in which a computer user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully  **presenting two or more pieces of evidence** (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has), and inherence (something only the user is). MFA protects the user from an unknown person trying to access their data such as personal ID details or financial assets. A third-party authenticator (TPA) app enables two-factor authentication, usually by showing a randomly-generated and constantly refreshing code to use for authentication._

Multi-factor authentication in the Amplify Platform is possible when your user account is managed in the Platform. If your account is managed by an external Identity Provider, then MFA is handled by that component.

To enable multi-factor authentication:

1. Select the **Credentials** link.
2. Select **Enabled** next to the **Multi-Factor Authentication** option. The **Preferred MFA Method** options becomes available.
3. For the **Preferred MFA Method**, select the default method a multi-factor authentication token will be generated for when logging in from a new device. Options are **Authenticator App**, **Email**, and **SMS**.

    | Preferred MFA method | How this works | When can this be used |
    | ---| --- | --- |
    | Authenticator App | A random code is generated within the app that needs to be provided when the user logs into the Platform. | Only available when an authenticator app has been configured for your account. See [Setup Authenticator App](#setup-authenticator-app) for details. |
    | Email | A code is sent to your email address that needs to be provided when the user logs into the Platform. | Always available, uses the email address linked to your account. |
    | SMS | A code is sent through SMS that needs to be provided when the user logs into the Platform. | Only available when a phone number is linked to your account. See [Verify your phone number](#verify-your-phone-number) for details. |

4. Click **Save**. Once the Enabled checkbox is selected and the account saved, multi-factor authentication will be enabled, and a notification email will be sent.

5. Depending on the preferred MFA method you selected, make sure to complete these steps:
    * Authenticator App - [Setup Authenticator App](#setup-authenticator-app)
    * SMS - [Verify your phone number](#verify-your-phone-number)
6. After you have enabled MFA and you login you will see a notification asking you to enter an authorization code. You might need to use another browser or a private browser session to test this. Enter the Authorization code provided by your Authenticator App,  email, or SMS, and then click **Authorize**.

    When the code is correctly validated, you will be successfully logged into the Platform.

To disable multi-factor authentication:

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
2. Deselect **Enabled** next to the **Multi-Factor Authentication** option.
3. Click **Save**.

Once the **Enabled** checkbox is deselected and the account saved, multi-factor authentication is disabled and a notification email is sent.

### Setup Authenticator App

Use an Authenticator App such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.

To setup an authenticator app:

1. Install an Authenticator App.
2. In the Platform, select the Credentials tab in the **Account** menu.
3. Click **Configure** next to **Set up Authentication App**. A popup appears with a QR code.
4. Scan the QR code with your Authenticator App.
5. Type the code from the Authenticator App into the modal dialog, and then click **Submit**. The Authenticator App is now configured.

## Manage settings

The **Settings** tab enables you to manage your organization account settings. You can configure the following settings:

* Select your organization account theme (Light, Dark, or Match OS)
* Expand or minimize side-bar menus
* Enable or disable demo data
* Select your org login rule
* Configure your inactivity logout timeframe
* Enable or disable restoring the previous page on your next login

![Branding page](/Images/settings_tab.png)

### Select the org login rule

If you are a member or owner of multiple accounts, to configure the login path and organization to log in to, select one of the following options from the **Org Login Rule** dropdown menu:

* **Use Last logged in Org** - The last account logged in to will be logged in to on the next login.
* **Use Default Org** - The default account will be logged in to on every login.
* **Always ask for Org** - You will be queried for which account to log in.

To view details of a listed organization, click on the organization name and refer to [Managing Organizations](/docs/management_guide/organizations/managing_organizations/).

### Configure your inactivity logout time

You can configure the amount of time before you are signed out of the Platform due to browser session inactivity. The options are 15 minutes, 30 minutes (default), 1 hour, or Disabled (do not log me out due to inactivity).

### Enable or disable restoring previous page on next login

You can enable or disable if you want to be redirected to the page previously viewed once signed back in after being signed out due to inactivity in the Platform. This setting is disabled by default (do not restore previous page on next login).
