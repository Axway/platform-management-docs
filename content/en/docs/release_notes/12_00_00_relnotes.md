## Platform Management 12.0.0 - 19 Oct 2022

Platform Management 12.0.0 is a major release which includes one new feature, one improvement, and one fixed issue.

## New feature

* Added new *Consumer Orgs* view for organizations entitled to **Marketplace** listing organizations which have signed up for their marketplace along with their counts of teams and users.

## Improvement

* Users may now be assigned multiple roles within a team. Some team roles have been renamed. See the [Team roles documentation](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/platform-management/page/docs/management_guide/organizations/organization_roles_and_features/index.html#team-roles) for more information.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue where users attempting to switch their logged-in organization to an inactive or invalid organization would regenerate a session in their prior logged-in organization.
