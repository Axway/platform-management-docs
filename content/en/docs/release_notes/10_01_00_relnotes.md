## Platform Management 10.0.1 - 25 March 2022

Platform Management 10.1.1 is a minor release which includes two new features and a fixed issue.

With this release, Insights (read only admin) and Collaborator role support has been removed. These deprecated roles were only available for organizations with Pro or Enterprise Application Development subscriptions. As those offerings reached end-of-support on Mar 1, 2022, all users with these deprecated roles assigned have been removed from their respective organizations. Events dated Mar 25, 2022 are noted in the _Activity_ view for these removed users. These users can be re-added if needed with Administrator or Developer role assigned.

## New features

* Added a Promotor Specialist service role available for subscribers of **Flow Manager**.
* Added a Subscription Admin team role available for subscribers of **Ampify API Management Platform** or **Ampify Hub**.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue where organization administrators were unable to delete a team without selecting a team to reassign its assets to.
