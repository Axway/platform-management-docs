DashboardÂ 4.2.1

Dashboard 4.2.1 is a patch release, which includes some behavior changes and bug fixes addressing high-priority issues from previous releases.

Behavior Changes

* Removed the Feedback link from the footer.
* In the Arrow application Overview page, renamed "Service URL" to "URL," and "CNAME" to "DOMAIN."
* When you click on the service URL in the Arrow application Overview page, the service will open in a new browser window. Previously, the service would open in the same window as Dashboard.

Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue where it took longer than expected to switch between organizations
* Fixed an issue where using a backslash ( `\` ) as part of the search term in the Apps menu would return a syntax error
