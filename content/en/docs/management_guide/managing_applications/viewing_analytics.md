## Unspecified metric names and values

In some cases, a value may be unknown, such as the name of an application that has been deleted. In such cases, a placeholder value – "(not set)" – or placeholder is displayed instead. The following describes why, when, and where these placeholder values appear.

### Version and environment values for Crash and Test metrics

When viewing Crash analytics, the **Version** and **Environment** drop-down menus display "(not set)" since version and environment are not available. For the same reason, graphs that display a version series of Crash metrics will display "(not set)".
