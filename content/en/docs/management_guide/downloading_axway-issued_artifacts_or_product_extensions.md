The Amplify Repository is where Axway-issued artifacts or product extensions are available for you to download directly from the Platform. Previously, the Axway Marketplace was where we had distributed Axway and 3rd party product extensions for a variety of Axway products and services. The Amplify Repository provides you a simpler and more consistent way to access and download your content through the Platform.

You can access the repository directly using the URL [https://repository.axway.com](https://repository.axway.com) or from the Download Center - **Extensions** link in the Platform's top navigation **Help & Resources** menu.

From the **Download Center** link, you can also click the **Products** link to go to the [Support Portal](https://support.axway.com/en/downloads/index/type/Downloads) downloads page.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}Titanium artifacts are no longer available through the Platform. If you need access to a Titanium artifact, or if you have questions about artifacts that you have purchased through the Axway Marketplace previously, please contact Axway at [marketplace-admin@axway.com](mailto:marketplace-admin@axway.com).{{% /alert %}}
