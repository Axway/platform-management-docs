## Platform Management 12.5.1 - 12 Jan 2023

Platform Management 12.5.1 is a patch release which includes two improvements and one changed behavior.

## Improvements

* Improved validation for certificates uploaded for URL configured on the *Marketplace Settings* view.

## Changed behavior

* The ability to enable and configure *Marketplace Homepage* content is now limited to organizations which have a Public Marketplace entitlement.
