An organization administrator can configure Identity Providers (IdP) and manage associated domains from the Organization's **Settings** tab. This functionality allows your organization members to authenticate with the Amplify Platform using your Identity Provider (IdP) credentials for Single Sign-On (SSO) instead of the Platform as your Identity Provider.
