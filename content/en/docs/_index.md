## Browser support

Browser support for the Amplify Platform Management interface is determined by active support by the browser vendor and market share greater than 0.1%. Generally, this includes vendors' last three major versions and other browsers based on their technology (such as Brave which is based on Chromium). However, it may exclude minor versions for which vendors have provided security updates.
