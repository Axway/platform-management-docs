The organization administrator can disassociate email domains with an Associated or Confirmed status by selecting **Remove IdP Association** from the **Actions** menu.

After the dissociation:

* The domain is returned to the Owned state.
* All users on the associated domain will revert to using the Amplify Platform for authentication.

If the organization administrator wants to associate the domain again, they must follow the same process to confirm the association to the same or a different IdP.
