The **Tooling Credentials** view enables you to create and change the password you use for tooling, such as the Appcelerator CLI, the Axway CLI  and the Platform APIs. This password is not used to log into Amplify Platform and it does not change your credentials with your identity provider.

1. From the [Account](/docs/management_guide/managing_accounts/) menu, click **Credentials**.
2. Enter a password in the **New Password** field. The password should be at least eight characters. As you enter a password in the **New Password** field, the **Confirm Password** field is displayed.
3. Confirm the new password in the **Confirm Password** field. The entry in the **Confirm Password** field must be the same as the entry in the **Password** field.
4. Click the **Save** button.
