## Platform Management 12.6.0 - 23 Jan 2023

Platform Management 12.6.0 is a minor release which includes one changed behavior, one new feature, and two fixed issues.

## Changed behavior

* With the **Flow Manager** 2.0 release, the Auditor role assignment is no longer available. The common navigation header's service switcher no longer contains a link to **Flow Manager** SaaS service. The *Overview* menu no longer contains links to the *Audit Search* UI.

## New feature

* The *Edit Identity Provider* form view now provides the ability to export and import its configuration.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue where some details in *Activity* views may display an entity's identifier rather than its name.
* Fixed an issue where attempting to navigate away from the *Marketplace Settings* view after saving changes may cause an unexpected confirmation dialog that the form has unsaved changes to show.
