* Installs
* Updates
* Version Adoption
* Unique Devices
* Events
* Custom Queries

Each sub-tab is explained below.

2. Click the **Actions** (**...**) menu, then select either:

    * **Refresh** - To refresh the data and the displayed analytics information**.** The elapsed time since the last data refresh is displayed.
    * **Custom Query** - (if the organization is entitled) To open that query inside the custom queries view.
    * **Chart Data** - To download the data in the chart.
    * **Chart Image** - To download the chart image.

## Unspecified metric names and values

In some cases, a metric's value may be unknown to the Dashboard analytics engine. In such cases, a placeholder value – "(not set)" – or placeholder is displayed instead. The following describes why, when, and where these placeholder values appear.

### Platform icons for Mobile Backend Services requests

In the metrics for Mobile Backend Services Requests, if a Mobile Backend Services API call originated from a source other than a Titanium application or native iOS application using Amplify Titanium SDK, an icon is displayed. For instance, this icon would appear for calls made to the Mobile Backend Services APIs using a command-line tool, such as cURL.

### Version and environment values for Crash and Test metrics

When viewing Test and Crash analytics, the **Version** and **Environment** drop-down menus display "(not set)" since version and environment are not available. For the same reason, graphs that display a version series of Crash or Test metrics will display "(not set)"

### Geographic analysis

On a metric's **Geo** tab, if the country could not be determined from the metric's included geographic coordinates or coordinates were not provided at all, "(not set)" is displayed as the Country name.
