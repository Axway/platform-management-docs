## Platform Management 12.8.1 - 28 Feb 2023

Platform Management 12.8.1 is an incremental release which includes one improvement and two fixed issues.

With this release, Platform Management API endpoints related to use of **Mobile Backend Services** and **Amplify Runtime Services** have been marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## Improvement

* Added informative modals to the *Edit User* view when an organization administrator changes the user's Identity Provider restriction. These modals indicate when next steps must be performed by the user in order for the change to apply.

## Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue on the *Edit User* view where a previously selected Identity Provider restriction may not be correctly displayed.
* Fixed an issue on the *Marketplace Homepage* settings view where the Hero Banner background gradient options may be incorrectly displayed.
