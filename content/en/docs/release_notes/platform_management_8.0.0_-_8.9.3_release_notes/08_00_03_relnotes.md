## Platform Management 8.0.3 - 10 August 2020

Platform Management 8.0.3 is a patch release, which includes two bug fixes.

With this release, integration with Appcelerator DevLink is no longer supported. Appcelerator DevLink has been discontinued and will no longer be available.

## Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where long-time Appcelerator community members who never set their name on their {{% variables/platform_prod_name %}} account may see an unexpected message when attempting to login.
* Fixed an issue in the _Custom Query_ view where changing a custom date range for a previously saved or previewed query may not show the correct date range for the returned data on a subsequent preview.
* Fixed an issue where users attempting to sign up using their GitHub account may receive an error.
