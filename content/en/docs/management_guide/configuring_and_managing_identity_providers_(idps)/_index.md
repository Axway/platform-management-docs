An organization administrator can configure Identity Providers (IdP) and manage associated domains from the Organization's **Settings** tab. This functionality allows your organization members to authenticate with the Amplify Platform using your Identity Provider (IdP) credentials for Single Sign-On (SSO) instead of the Platform as your Identity Provider.

Refer to [Getting Started with Identity Providers](/docs/management_guide/configuring_and_managing_identity_providers_idps/getting_started_with_identity_providers/) for details.
