Platform Management 8.2.0 - 30 September 2020

Platform Management 8.2.0 is a minor release, which includes two new features and an improvement.

New features

* Signing up for **Amplify Platform** now allows new users to select the data privacy region in which their organization's customer data will reside.
* Added a _Download Center_ menu in the common header's _Help & Resources_ menu replacing the previous _Marketplace_ link and linking to product and product extension resources.

Improvement

* Consolidated **Amplify** **Central** and **Flow Manager** service roles for _Analytics Specialist_ into a single **Visibility** service role. The existing _Auditor_ role has also been relocated to **Visibility** services roles.
