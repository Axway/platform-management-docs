## Platform Management 12.5.0 - 15 Dec 2022

Platform Management 12.5.0 is a minor release which includes one new feature, two improvements, and one fixed issue.

## New feature

* With this release, organizations which are entitled may configure multiple marketplaces. See the document for more information on [publishing products to one or more marketplaces](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/manage_marketplace/publish_to_marketplace/index.html).

## Improvements

* Organizations which were previously entitled and had established marketplaces may still access the *Marketplaces* view.
* Non-administrator role users may now access the *Marketplaces* view in order to navigate to the organization's marketplaces.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue where users logging into marketplaces which have been configured to run on a custom URL may not be redirected to the marketplace after authenticating.
