## Platform Management 12.7.0 - 31 Jan 2023

Platform Management 12.7.0 is a minor release which includes two improvements and one fixed issue.

## Improvements

* Improved authentication flow experience when signing in from a marketplace and the provided user's email is associated with a **Platform** organization. If the address is associated with one or more consumer organizations for the marketplace, the user will be prompted to select which account they wish to sign in to.
* Added counts for published products and subscriptions on the *Marketplaces* view.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue where user event type was selectable on the organization *Activity* view and may cause unexpected behavior when selected. User events are displayed on the user's *Activity* view.
